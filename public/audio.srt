1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Ever wished you could have

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,880
like a website or an

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,420
app designed, you know, like

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,160
in the blink of an

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,900
eye, perfectly tailored to your

6
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,700
exact needs?

7
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,760
Well, that's exactly what we're

8
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,460
diving into today, generative UI.

9
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,580
Yeah, it's not just about

10
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,920
making things look pretty, though

11
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,080
it can certainly do that.

12
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,780
It's about having, you know,

13
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,380
like an AI craft digital

14
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,920
interfaces that adapt to you,

15
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,280
you know, in real time.

16
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,820
No more wrestling with clunky

17
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,480
menus or trying to find

18
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
that one button hidden in

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,540
a sea of options.

20
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,800
This is about interfaces that

21
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,940
almost understand what you want

22
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,920
to achieve and they morph

23
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,140
to help you get there.

24
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,300
It's fascinating. You know, Harrison

25
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,620
Chase, the founder of LangChain,

26
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,600
he's been talking about how

27
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,140
user experience is this major

28
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,220
bottleneck in AI development.

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,400
He argues that if we

30
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
want AI to truly be

31
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,880
helpful, it needs to interact

32
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,560
with us in a way

33
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,020
that feels natural.

34
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,060
Intuitive.

35
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,480
Generative UI might just be

36
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,000
the key.

37
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,260
That makes total sense. It's

38
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,620
like we've been so focused

39
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,680
on on building the brains

40
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,000
of these AI systems that

41
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,300
we forgot about the face

42
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,060
they show to the world.

43
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,520
Exactly. And that's where generative

44
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,500
UI gets really interesting.

45
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,240
It's like having an AI

46
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,500
design assistant that can just

47
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,660
whip up a custom made

48
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,440
interface for any task on

49
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,880
the fly.

50
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,540
Like imagine telling your AI,

51
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,200
I need to book a

52
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,940
flight to Paris.

53
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
And instead of being, you

54
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,860
know, redirected to some generic

55
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,000
booking site, it creates a

56
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,980
streamlined interface right there in

57
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,260
front of you with only

58
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,420
the options relevant to your

59
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,760
request.

60
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,600
Now, that's what I'm talking

61
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,260
about. It sounds almost magical.

62
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,620
But how does it how

63
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,320
does it actually work?

64
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,080
Are we talking about AI

65
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,480
writing lines of code from

66
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,880
scratch?

67
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,700
In a way, yes. There

68
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,360
are different approaches to generative

69
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,660
UI. And one way to

70
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,120
think about it is is

71
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,160
on a spectrum of control.

72
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,220
On one end, you have

73
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,600
what we call true generative

74
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,580
UI, where the AI has,

75
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,880
you know, free reign to

76
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,780
generate the raw HTML, CSS

77
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,620
and JavaScript that that make

78
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,040
up a website or app.

79
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,180
So it's like it's like

80
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,260
unleashing an AI artist with

81
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,200
a license to design, you

82
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
know, however it pleases.

83
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,860
That sounds both exciting and

84
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,880
potentially terrifying.

85
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,960
Yeah. You hit the nail

86
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,320
on the head. While the

87
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,360
the potential for innovation is

88
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,820
huge.

89
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
You know, giving an AI

90
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,640
that much freedom can can

91
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,300
lead to unpredictable results.

92
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,060
Think flashing buttons, misaligned text,

93
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,140
the whole nine yards, at

94
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,840
least with the current limitations

95
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
of AI.

96
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,580
Right. It's like it's like

97
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,080
those AI image generators. You

98
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
might get a masterpiece or

99
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,080
you might get something that

100
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,220
looks like it belongs in

101
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,300
a modern art museum.

102
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,180
Yeah. Yeah. Intriguing, but not

103
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,960
always functional.

104
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
So what about the other

105
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,140
end of the spectrum? What

106
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,980
if what if you want

107
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,020
a bit more control over

108
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,680
the AI's creative output?

109
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,660
That's where guarded generative UI

110
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,440
comes into play.

111
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
Instead of giving the AI

112
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,620
complete freedom, we set some

113
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,500
boundaries, some design guardrails within

114
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,380
which it can operate.

115
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,480
Think of it like providing

116
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,100
the AI with with a

117
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,660
set of templates, style guides,

118
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,740
free approved components.

119
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,240
So it's still generating the

120
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,520
interface dynamically, but it's it's

121
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,460
playing within a defined sandbox,

122
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,240
ensuring a more a more

123
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,880
consistent and polished look and

124
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,200
feel.

125
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,100
Precisely. It may not have

126
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,480
the same element of surprise

127
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,940
as true generative UI.

128
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,160
OK.

129
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,780
But it offers a greater

130
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,720
degree of predictability and control,

131
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,080
which is essential for, you

132
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,380
know, many real world applications.

133
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,240
Right. It's a it's a

134
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,860
classic tradeoff freedom versus finesse.

135
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,080
But enough theory.

136
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm itching to see how

137
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,820
this how this generative UI

138
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,900
magic plays out in the

139
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,360
real world.

140
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,440
What are some of the

141
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,040
tools and projects that are

142
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,420
that are pushing the boundaries

143
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,280
of what's possible?

144
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
One cool example is this,

145
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,220
this combination of React, a

146
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,420
popular JavaScript library for for

147
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,660
building user interfaces with open

148
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,620
AIs language model.

149
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,700
OK. Open AI, the the

150
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
folks behind ChatGPT. So we're

151
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,500
we're talking about combining the

152
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
power of AIs language processing

153
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,840
with the the flexibility of

154
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,980
a web development framework.

155
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,880
Exactly. Picture this. You're a

156
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
developer and you need to

157
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,540
create a simple contact form.

158
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,520
Instead of writing all the

159
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,380
code by hand, you just

160
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,140
type a prompt into your

161
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,660
code editor, like create a

162
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,860
form with fields for name,

163
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,000
email and a submit button.

164
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
And the and the AI

165
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,380
just conjures up the code

166
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,360
right there in your editor,

167
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,040
like magic.

168
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
Pretty much. Open AIs model,

169
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,460
it generates the JSX code,

170
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,880
which is then converted into,

171
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,580
you know, browser ready JavaScript

172
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,800
using a tool called Babel.

173
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,580
The really cool part is

174
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,680
that this code is then

175
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,840
executed dynamically using JavaScript's function

176
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,780
constructor, meaning the interface is

177
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,780
literally built on the fly.

178
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Wow. That's seriously impressive. It's

179
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,420
it's not just about generating

180
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,820
static code. It's about that

181
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,600
code, you know, coming to

182
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,680
life and and responding to

183
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,460
user interactions in real time.

184
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
You've got it. And this

185
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,340
is just scratching the surface

186
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,360
of what's possible. Have you

187
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,080
heard of Vercel?

188
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,720
Vercel. They're the company behind

189
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,500
Next.js, a popular framework

190
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
for building React applications.

191
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,560
The name Vercel rings a

192
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,420
bell. They're they're really making

193
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,840
waves in the development world.

194
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,080
Right.

195
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,140
What what have they got

196
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,520
to do with generative UI?

197
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,060
Well, they've they've released this

198
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,440
tool called Vercel V0.

199
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,780
And and let me tell

200
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,040
you, it's it's causing quite

201
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,340
a stir.

202
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,720
With VL, you can describe

203
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,740
what you want your UI

204
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,100
to look like using natural

205
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,900
language, plain English.

206
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,140
Wait, hold on. You're you're

207
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,800
telling me I can just

208
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,540
tell this tool what I

209
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,360
want my website to look

210
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,420
like and it'll it'll spit

211
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,180
out the code for me.

212
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,360
You got it. And not

213
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
and not just any code.

214
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,780
It generates ready to use

215
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,100
React code that integrates seamlessly

216
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,300
with with popular libraries like

217
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Tailwind CSS.

218
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,740
So I don't even need

219
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,180
to be like a coding

220
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,820
whiz to use this V0

221
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,160
thing.

222
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,020
Like I can just tell

223
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,380
it, make me a website

224
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,800
that looks like a tropical

225
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,240
island and and it'll just

226
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,800
handle it.

227
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,240
Well, well, maybe not quite

228
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,540
that detail, but you're you're

229
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,180
getting the idea.

230
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,800
The the real power of

231
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,540
V0 lies in its ability

232
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,680
to kind of translate your

233
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,220
intent into into functional code.

234
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
It's like having a conversation

235
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,180
with with a designer who

236
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,420
also happens to speak fluent

237
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,680
React.

238
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
That's incredible. But but it

239
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,120
makes you wonder what what

240
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,020
happens to the role of

241
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,500
the developer then if if

242
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,920
AI can, you know, generate

243
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,020
code from simple descriptions.

244
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
Are we all out of

245
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,600
a job?

246
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah, that's that's a question

247
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,420
a lot of people are

248
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,700
asking.

249
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,580
And it speaks to to

250
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,840
the evolving relationship between humans

251
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,280
and AI.

252
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Well, it's true that tools

253
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,380
like V0 can, you know,

254
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,840
automate certain coding tasks.

255
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,300
The the role of the

256
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,680
developer is far from obsolete.

257
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,420
In fact, it's it's becoming

258
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,580
even more important.

259
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,160
How so?

260
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,980
Because because crafting effective prompts

261
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,820
for these AI tools is

262
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,680
an art in itself.

263
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,020
Yeah.

264
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,260
You need to be able

265
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,320
to clearly articulate your vision,

266
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,500
you know, understand the nuances

267
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,060
of design, anticipate potential pitfalls.

268
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,520
It's it's not just about

269
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
what you want.

270
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,840
It's it's how you communicate

271
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,540
it to the AI.

272
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,880
So it's less about replacing

273
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,620
developers and more about augmenting

274
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,160
their abilities, giving them the

275
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
power to do more faster

276
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,780
and with greater precision.

277
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,880
Exactly. And the really exciting

278
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
thing is that this is

279
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,300
still, you know, early days.

280
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,960
Vercel isn't the only player

281
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,540
in this field.

282
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
There's there's a whole ecosystem

283
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,100
of of open source projects

284
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,640
like like Open V0, Prompt

285
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,580
2E, V0, Copilot Next that

286
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,620
are that are pushing the

287
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,040
boundaries of what's possible with

288
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,620
generative UI.

289
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,500
It's like a whole new

290
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,760
frontier for creativity and innovation.

291
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
What else is out there?

292
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,880
What should we be keeping

293
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,500
our eye on?

294
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
One development that has me

295
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,660
particularly excited is is Anthropics

296
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,000
Claude Sonnet 3.5.

297
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,980
This this AI model is

298
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,400
is making waves with its

299
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,320
its unique artifacts feature.

300
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,740
Artifacts. That sounds intriguing.

301
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,720
What makes them so special?

302
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,580
Imagine this.

303
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,120
You're you're working with Claude

304
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,200
asking it to to design

305
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,420
like a website layout.

306
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,960
As it's generating the code,

307
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
it it doesn't just show

308
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,640
you a wall of text.

309
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,780
Instead, it creates these these

310
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
dynamic visual representations of what

311
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,880
it's what it's building.

312
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,780
And these artifacts appear alongside

313
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,600
your conversation.

314
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,580
So you so you can

315
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,420
actually see the design taking

316
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,500
shape in in real time

317
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,100
as you're interacting with the

318
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,380
AI.

319
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,700
Exactly. It's like having a

320
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,260
live feedback loop between your

321
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,920
ideas and the AI's interpretation

322
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,340
of them.

323
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,220
That's incredible. It sounds like

324
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,920
it could revolutionize the design

325
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,100
process, making it much more

326
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
collaborative and iterative.

327
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,280
Absolutely. And this brings us

328
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,040
to another crucial aspect of

329
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,760
generative UI.

330
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,960
The the tools that bridge

331
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,680
the gap between AI models

332
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,160
and the interfaces we use

333
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,520
every day for cell ones

334
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,360
again is is at the

335
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,460
forefront of this with their

336
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,880
with their for cell AI

337
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,340
SDK.

338
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,660
The Vercel AI SDK. Tell

339
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,820
me more. What makes it

340
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,300
so special?

341
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,540
Think of it as a

342
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,560
as a toolkit, a collection

343
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
of building blocks that developers

344
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,880
can use to to integrate

345
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,380
generative UI into into their

346
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,780
projects.

347
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,260
It's it's broken down into

348
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,080
three main components. The AI

349
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
SDK core, the AI SDK

350
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,800
UI and the AI SDK

351
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,340
RSC.

352
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,060
OK, let's let's unpack that.

353
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
What's the what's the what's

354
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,080
the AI SDK core all

355
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,320
about?

356
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,640
It's the it's the engine

357
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,840
room, if you will. It

358
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,120
provides the the fundamental functions

359
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,420
for for interacting with AI

360
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,240
models like like generating text,

361
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,800
streaming content, creating structured data.

362
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,720
So it handles all the

363
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,180
behind the scenes communication with

364
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,920
the AI, allowing developers to

365
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,420
focus on building the the

366
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,400
user facing element.

367
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,680
Exactly. And that's where the

368
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,380
AI SDK UI comes in.

369
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,060
It provides developers with with

370
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,480
prebuilt components and hooks for

371
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
creating those those seamless interactive

372
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,620
experiences that that we've been

373
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,120
talking about.

374
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
So instead of writing all

375
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,220
that code from scratch, developers

376
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,900
can leverage these prebuilt elements

377
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,500
to to quickly assemble chat

378
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,360
interfaces, autocomplete features and even

379
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,180
those those handy AI assistants.

380
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,700
Precisely. And then there's the

381
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,840
AI SDK RSC. This one

382
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,680
is a bit more technical,

383
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,920
but equally important.

384
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,820
Don't worry, I'm ready for

385
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,480
it. Hit me with the

386
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,200
technical details.

387
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,680
Well, RSC stands for for

388
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,960
React server components. Yeah. And

389
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,860
it's a it's a powerful

390
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,240
way to build web applications

391
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
that are that are both

392
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,060
fast and dynamic.

393
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
OK, I'm vaguely familiar with

394
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
React, but how does how

395
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,020
does RSC fit into this

396
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,160
whole generative UI picture?

397
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,340
In a nutshell, RSC allows

398
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,960
you to render UI components

399
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,700
on the server instead of

400
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,020
the the client's browser, sending

401
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,540
only the essential information over

402
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,960
the wire.

403
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,680
This this this results in

404
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,400
faster loading times and a

405
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,720
smoother user experience, which is

406
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,400
crucial for those those dynamic

407
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,940
AI powered interfaces we've been

408
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,280
discussing.

409
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,580
So it's like having the

410
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,860
AI and the server working

411
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,560
together behind the scenes to

412
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,860
to create a seamless responsive

413
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,200
experience for the user.

414
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
You got it. And the

415
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
and the in the AI

416
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,260
SDK RSC is specifically designed

417
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,440
to leverage the the power

418
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,340
of server components.

419
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,840
Yeah. Allowing you to dynamically

420
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,880
stream UI elements based on

421
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,800
the AI's responses.

422
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
That's incredible. It sounds like

423
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,280
a match made in heaven.

424
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,620
AI generating the ideas, RSC

425
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,020
handling the technical heavy lifting

426
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,520
and and the user enjoying

427
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,020
a smooth personalized experience.

428
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
It's a it's a powerful

429
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,520
combination and it highlights how

430
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,980
the the different pieces of

431
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,240
the generative UI puzzle are

432
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,940
starting to come together.

433
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,320
So we've gone from AI

434
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,080
generating lines of code to

435
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,680
like dynamically building entire user

436
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,440
interfaces in in real time,

437
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,920
all thanks to these powerful

438
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,060
tools like like the Vercel

439
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,880
AI SDK.

440
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Where do we go from

441
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,720
here? What what does the

442
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,160
future hold for generative UI?

443
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,820
Oh, it's an exciting time

444
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,140
to be, you know, following

445
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,760
this space.

446
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,840
Imagine AI that doesn't just

447
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,260
follow instructions, but like it

448
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,320
understands context.

449
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,640
It anticipates needs, maybe even

450
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,380
surprises us with with its

451
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,880
creativity.

452
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,220
So less like following a

453
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,340
recipe and more like having

454
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,260
a true design partner, pushing

455
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,620
the boundaries of what's possible.

456
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Exactly. And and as those

457
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,360
AI models evolve, so will

458
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,180
the the tools and frameworks

459
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,200
we use to kind of

460
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,020
harness their power.

461
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,140
Right. The Vercel AI SDK

462
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,800
is a great example, but

463
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,780
it's just the beginning.

464
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
We'll see even more specialized

465
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,060
tools emerge, giving giving developers

466
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,500
greater flexibility and control over

467
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
the entire generative UI process.

468
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,000
It's it's like handing incredibly

469
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,700
powerful tools to a new

470
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,240
generation of of digital architects

471
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,260
who knows what kind of

472
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,180
of incredible experiences they'll create.

473
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,680
It makes you wonder what

474
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,580
what will the world look

475
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,500
like when when anyone can

476
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,060
create a custom made digital

477
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,160
experience with just a few

478
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,620
words?

479
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,540
How how how will this

480
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,780
change the way we work,

481
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
learn and interact with each

482
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,520
other online?

483
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,860
Those are some big questions.

484
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,880
It feels like we're we're

485
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,820
on the cusp of a

486
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,960
of a major shift in

487
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,040
how we how we think

488
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
about and interact with technology.

489
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
Absolutely. And it's not just

490
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
about the technology itself. It's

491
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,460
it's about the possibilities it

492
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:57,780
unlocks.

493
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,520
Imagine a world where where

494
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,880
education is is personalized for

495
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,660
each student, where where health

496
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,180
care is more accessible and

497
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,940
tailored to your specific needs,

498
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,460
where where entertainment is a

499
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,180
truly immersive and interactive experience.

500
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,980
Generative UI could be could

501
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,160
be the key to unlocking

502
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,220
all of this and more.

503
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,120
It's it's mind blowing to

504
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
think about the the potential

505
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,160
impact this could have on

506
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,600
our lives.

507
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,760
It feels like we're we're

508
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
just scratching the surface of

509
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,560
what's possible.

510
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,780
We are. And that's what

511
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,880
makes this such an exciting

512
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,780
field to be a part

513
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:25,960
of.

514
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,500
Generative UI isn't just about

515
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,120
changing the way we design

516
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,660
interfaces.

517
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960
It's about changing the way

518
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,780
we experience the world around

519
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,120
us.

520
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,860
I don't think I'll ever

521
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,900
look at my phone or

522
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,100
computer the same way again.

523
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,520
This has been an incredible

524
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
deep dive. I I feel

525
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,480
like I need to go

526
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,560
back and process all of

527
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,760
this.

528
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,960
This amazing information.

529
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,960
Yeah, it's been it's been

530
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,700
a pleasure exploring these these

531
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,520
ideas with you.

532
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,940
Until next time.
